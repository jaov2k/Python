Theres a lot on the line for Facebook. The company already faces antitrust lawsuits from the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of state attorneys general that have seen broad bipartisan support. Trumps suspension from the platform seemed to rile up conservatives who had already felt the company was too powerful, motivating them to join with Democrats seeking reforms to antitrust law and the legal liability shield that protects tech platforms known as Section 230.

Even if Facebook allows Trump back on the platform, its hard to know if Republicans will forgive the original suspension, while Democrats will likely be motivated to push even harder for reforms.
